Module containing code specific to beamline I19 at the Diamond Light Source

You need to have a Python environment containing DIALS to use it. You can then install it with::

    libtbx.pip install screen19

If you want to develop screen19 then check out a local copy of the repository and install it with::

    git clone git@github.com:xia2/screen19.git
    libtbx.pip install -e screen19

You then need to rebuild libtbx to get the screen19 dispatcher.
